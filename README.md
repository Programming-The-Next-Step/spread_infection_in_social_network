# spread_infection_in_social_network

## Project description
In my project I will construct an app that simulates the spread of an infectious disease on the userâ€™s own social network. 
I will start with implementing a user interface, which is used to create the social network. 
When this works correctly and the user can change several aspects (e.g. gender of friends in his/her social network), I will add the part that simulates the infection. 
If I am short on time, I will reduce the number of features the user can change about his/her social network. 
On the contrary, if I have extra time, I would like expand the input options for the user, and include the reproductive factor of the corona-virus in the world/Netherlands in the simulation.
